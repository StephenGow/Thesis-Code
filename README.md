# Thesis-Code
Code written as part of my PhD at University of Southampton, 2014-2021. Includes functions to make predictions from a chain of linked models using Gaussian process emulation, and for sensitivity analysis of the resulting linked emulator.

This code is no longer maintained and is retained for historical reasons only. If you wish to make use of linked GP emulators for real, the package DGPSI (https://github.com/mingdeyu/dgpsi-R) is likely to be your best bet.
